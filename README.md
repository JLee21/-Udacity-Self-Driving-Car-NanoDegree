### Project 1
Detected highway lane lines on a video stream. Used OpencV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection.


### [Project 2](https://github.com/JLee21/Udacity-Self-Driving-Car-NanoDegree-Term-1/tree/master/p2-traffic-signs/traffic-sign-classifier-project)
Build and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Experimented with different network architectures. Performed image pre-processing and validation to guard against overfitting.

### [Project 3](https://github.com/JLee21/Udacity-Self-Driving-Car-NanoDegree/tree/master/p3-behavioural-cloning/carnd-behavioral-cloning-p3)
Build and trained a convolutional neural network for end-to-end driving in a simulator, using TensorFlow and Keras. Used optimization techniques such as regularization and dropout to generalize the network for driving on multiple tracks.

### [Project 4](https://github.com/JLee21/Udacity-Self-Driving-Car-NanoDegree/tree/master/p4-advanced-lane-finding/carnd-advanced-lane-lines)
Build an advanced lane-finding algorithm using distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding. Identified lane curvature and vehicle displacement. Overcame environmental challenges such as shadows and pavement changes.

### [Project 5](https://github.com/JLee21/Udacity-Self-Driving-Car-NanoDegree/tree/master/p5-vehicle-detection/carnd-vehicle-detection)
Detect and track vehicles on a road using a trained SVM model and Computer Vision Techniques.

### Project 6
Implement an Extended Kalman Filter algorithm in C++ capable of tracking a pedestrian's motion in two dimensions.

### Project 7
Implement an Unscented Kalman Filter algorithm in C++ capable of accurately and performantly tracking a turning object.

### Project 8
Implement a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++ capable of localizing a vehicle within desired accuracy and time.

### [Project 9](https://github.com/JLee21/PID-Control)
Implement a PID controller in C++ to maneuver a vehicle around a track.

### [Project 10](https://github.com/JLee21/Model-Predictive-Control)
Implement Model Predictive Control to drive a vehicle around a track even with additional latency between commands.

### [Project 11](https://github.com/JLee21/Path-Planning)
Built a path planner that navigates a vehicle through traffic on a highway. Used the concepts taught in the module - environmental prediction, behavioral planning, and trajectory generation - to build the planner.

### [Project 12](https://github.com/JLee21/Semantic-Segmentation)
Labeled the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).

### [Project 13](https://github.com/JLee21/CarND-Capstone)
The glorious end project to Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.
This repository contains the results of Team "Wow That Was Fast"'s capstone project for the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program. The project utilizes Ubuntu Linux 14.04 with Robot Operating System (ROS) Indigo and/or Ubuntu Linux 16.04 with ROS Kinetic, the Udacity System Integration Simulator, and code written in C++ and Python to provide a System Integration solution to the self-driving car problem. The code developed will be tested on Udacity's real-world test vehicle (a Lincoln MKZ that the company has named "Carla") during December 2017.
